Homework 3

I have created a program that creates a graph showing a map of the Order Parameter distribution. The data comes from atomistic simulations using the molecular dynamics method, then the order parameter was computed. Exemplary files are aluminum bi-crystal, the grain boundary is between the grains, the orientation is (210) [100].
